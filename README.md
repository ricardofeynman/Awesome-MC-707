"Tools for deriving sysex maps for Roland ZenCore synthesizers with documented support (Jupiter-Xm, Fantom) and controlling the synths via sysex using Midi Fighter Twister controllers. Unfortunately the MC-707 doesn't seem to have sysex support :( " Thank You @asutherland We feel your pain.

Dear Roland really dropped a stinker on us when they prevented this guy's efforts from inspiring a DIY community value-added custom clone scene. Please consider reversing this in v1.83. Thank You Benis67 It was beautiful while it lasted. (I have had success on my unit downgrading the firmware to have fun with these offerings, and then jumping back to 1.82. YMMV)

Empty - forever...? Hopefully Doc K shares their findings from the zeninspector one day soon.
